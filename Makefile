# General-purpose CSV data loading (read/parse/shuffle flat input/target
# rows), reusable by any example that wants CSV-backed training data --
# unlike gesture_data.o/fall_data.o (each specific to one example's own
# synthetic generator), this has no domain-specific logic of its own. Not
# part of libnn.a for the same reason as those two: it's a desktop-side
# training-data utility, not something an embedded target would want built
# into the library. No root tool uses it directly, so it isn't part of

# On-device-reusable audio feature extraction (framing/FFT/mel

# into firmware alongside nn.o: a keyword-spotting target has to run the
# exact same feature extraction against its live mic buffer that prepared
# its training data, or the model sees different features at inference than
# it was trained on. Still not part of libnn.a (it isn't neural-net code)
# or of `all` (no root tool uses it directly) -- examples/*/Makefile

# Desktop-only 16-bit PCM mono WAV decoder -- same category as data_prep.o
