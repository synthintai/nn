// Turns raw PCM audio into the log-mel feature frames a sequence model
// (LAYER_TYPE_RNN/GRU/LSTM, see nn.h) can consume one timestep at a time --
// the piece nn.[ch] alone doesn't provide. Unlike everything else added
// alongside this file (data_prep.[ch], wav_reader.[ch], and every
// examples/*/ file), this one is meant to ship into firmware next to
// nn.c/nn.h: the exact same audio_features_frame()/
// audio_features_extract_sequence() calls that turn a training corpus into
// feature rows also have to run, unchanged, against a deployed target's
// live mic buffer -- otherwise the model sees different features at
// inference than it was trained on. It has no file-I/O dependency of its
// own (see wav_reader.[ch] for that, which is desktop-only) and does no
// heap allocation outside of audio_features_init()/audio_features_free(),
// so a single audio_features_t can be created once at startup and reused,
// allocation-free, for every subsequent frame.
//
// Not part of libnn.a (it isn't neural-net code) -- see the top-level
// Makefile's audio_features.o rule.

// `out[t * af->num_mel_bins]`), then normalizes the whole sequence to zero
// mean and unit variance in place -- see this function's definition in
// audio_features.c for why that's done here (self-contained, per clip)
// rather than left to the caller. Because normalization needs the whole
// sequence's statistics, this is a batch operation over a fixed window,
// not an incremental/streaming one -- audio_features_frame() remains the
// building block for a caller that wants raw, unnormalized per-frame
// energies one at a time. `out` must have room for
// audio_features_num_frames(af, num_samples, hop) * af->num_mel_bins
