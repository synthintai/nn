# Character Recognition

Trains a network to recognize handwritten digits (MNIST) -- two architectures on the same data, so you can see what the convolutional layers actually buy you.

## In an embedded system

Handwritten-digit recognition is the "hello world" of embedded computer vision, but it's not just a toy: the same shape of model is what runs behind a smart pen digitizing handwritten forms, a point-of-sale device reading a handwritten amount, a meter reader OCR-ing a dial, or a postal sorter reading a ZIP code -- anywhere a small, fixed-size image needs to become a class label on-device, without round-tripping to a server. This `nn` library's own hardware demo (see the top-level README) is exactly this: a handwritten-character recognizer running live on an STM32H7 microcontroller.

This example trains two different architectures on the identical data, so the tradeoff a real embedded project faces -- accuracy vs. compute/memory budget vs. how much of that budget the *shape* of the network costs you, not just its raw size -- is something you can actually see numbers for, rather than take on faith.

## Model architecture

### `train_cnn.c` -- convolution + pooling ahead of the fully-connected layers

![CNN architecture: Input 28x28x1, 5x5 conv x8 same padding to 28x28x8, 2x2 max pool to 14x14x8, a second 5x5 conv x16 same padding to 14x14x16, a second 2x2 max pool to 7x7x16, flatten into a 120-unit GELU FC layer, 30% dropout, a 20-unit GELU FC layer, then a 10-way softmax output](architecture_cnn.svg)

| Layer | Type | Output shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Input | 28×28×1 | one channel, raw pixel intensities |
| 1 | CNN | 28×28×8 | 5×5 kernel, 8 filters, stride 1, "same" padding (keeps the full 28×28 instead of shrinking to 24×24, so digit strokes near the border still get seen by every kernel position) |
| 2 | Pool | 14×14×8 | 2×2 max pool, stride 2 |
| 3 | CNN | 14×14×16 | 5×5 kernel, 16 filters, stride 1, "same" padding -- a second round of feature extraction (edges-of-edges, not just edges) over the first stage's pooled output |
| 4 | Pool | 7×7×16 | 2×2 max pool, stride 2 |
| 5 | FC | 120 | GELU |
| 6 | Dropout | 120 | 30%, training only |
| 7 | FC | 20 | GELU |
| 8 | Output | 10 | Softmax (cross-entropy loss) |

~100K trainable parameters -- roughly half of a single-conv-stage version of this same network (~191K), despite adding a whole extra layer. Both convolutions together still contribute almost none of that (208 + 3,216 = 3,424 weights): the first FC layer is still what dominates the parameter count, but a *second* conv+pool stage shrinks what reaches it (7×7×16 = 784, flattened) instead of a single, wider stage growing it -- widening the first stage to 16 filters instead (an alternative that was measured, not just assumed inferior) still leaves a single 14×14×8→flatten, doubling the FC layer's input to 3,136 and its weight count right along with it, for a smaller accuracy gain than adding this second stage does. See [How they compare](#how-they-compare) below for the measured numbers behind that claim.

### `train_fc.c` -- plain fully-connected network, no convolution

![FC architecture: Input 784, dense all-to-all into a 128-unit GELU FC layer, then a 64-unit GELU FC layer, then a 10-way softmax output](architecture_fc.svg)

| Layer | Type | Output shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Input | 784 | flattened 28×28 pixels, no spatial structure |
| 1 | FC | 128 | GELU |
| 2 | FC | 64 | GELU |
| 3 | Output | 10 | Softmax (cross-entropy loss) |

~109K trainable parameters -- fewer than the CNN, despite having no convolution/pooling at all, since every one of its FC layers is smaller. Every input pixel connects directly to every unit in the first FC layer: no shared weights, no spatial locality, no translation invariance. This is the baseline a CNN is normally justified against.

### How they compare

A real run of each (see [Sample output](#sample-output) below for the full logs):

| | Parameters | Epochs to converge | Test accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `train_cnn` | ~100K | 11 | 98.49% |
| `train_fc` | ~109K | 8 | 96.13% |

Your numbers will vary run to run (random weight init, shuffled data), but expect the CNN to consistently edge out the FC network on this task -- the point of having both examples side by side.

`train_cnn.c`'s two-conv-stage shape above isn't the only one that was tried -- measured against two alternatives on the same data (two runs each, since a single run isn't enough to separate a real difference from ordinary run-to-run noise):

| | Parameters | Test accuracy (2 runs) | Avg |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single stage, 8 filters | ~191K | 97.64%, 97.73% | 97.69% |
| Single stage, 16 filters | ~379K | 97.77%, 98.31% | 98.04% |
| **Two stages, 8→16 filters (current)** | **~100K** | **98.44%, 98.49%** | **98.47%** |

Widening the single conv stage to 16 filters does buy back some accuracy over the original 8-filter version, but at roughly double the parameters (since the flattened width feeding the first FC layer doubles right along with it). Adding a second, narrower conv+pool stage instead beat both -- higher accuracy *and* about half the parameters of even the original 8-filter version -- which is why it's what ships here.

## Build and run

```
cd examples/character_recognition
make
```
This also downloads the MNIST dataset (`samples.csv`, ~110MB, cached after the first run) and splits it into `train.csv`/`validation.csv`/`test.csv` via `split.py` (see the top-level README for that script's `--train`/`--validation` options).

Train the CNN:
```
./train_cnn model_cnn.txt
```
Train the plain FC network (use a different `<model-file>` than the CNN's -- a model built by one architecture can't be resumed by the other):
```
./train_fc model_fc.txt
```
Either can be resumed/fine-tuned by re-running the same command against an existing model file.

Evaluate either (the same `test.c` works for both, since it just reads whatever the model's input/output widths are):
```
./test model_cnn.txt
./test model_fc.txt
```

Run inference against a trained model:
```
./predict model_cnn.txt
```
