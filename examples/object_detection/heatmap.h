// class is centered there -- into a list of detected objects. Shared by

// white cell, 2 platelets". No heap allocation.

// each as one detection, centered at the value-weighted average position
// of that 3x3 neighborhood (so an object straddling two cells lands between
// them, not snapped to one). Writes up to `max_detections` to `out` and
