// Turns a decoded microscope camera frame into the fixed-size, normalized
// network input train.c's model expects. Shared by prepare_data.c
// (building the training CSVs) and predict.c (counting the cells in one
// new image), so the two can't drift out of sync -- and, like
// ../image_classification/image_prep.[ch], this is the part a deployed
// device's firmware would run too, against its own frame buffer. No file
// I/O and no heap allocation; decoding a JPEG into the `pixels` buffer is
// the caller's job (../../stb_image.h here, the camera's own driver on a
// real target).
//
// Unlike ../image_classification, which crops a square around one animal,
// this keeps the whole frame: a detector has to look everywhere, and the
// frame's 4:3 shape is kept so cells aren't squashed.
